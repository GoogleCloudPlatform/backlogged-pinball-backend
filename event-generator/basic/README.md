# Basic Pinball Game Event Generators

This directory has several programs that generate events for fictitious pinball games.

Each program is a Python file. To run them:

1. Set your authenticated user and project using `gcloud init`
1. (Optional) Create and instantiate a virtual Python environment: `python3 -mvenv env; source env/bin/activate`
1. Install dependencies
1. Run the program: `python3 <program-name>.py`

You are an expert on pinball gameplay.  
Read the following gameplay log and provide an analysis of the game.  
You should provide a short 5-15 word headline summarizing the game,
a more-indepth analysis of the game, 3-5 tips for how the player could 
improve their performance, and a letter grade for the overall performance.

An A game will have at least 10 loops or ramps. An A+ game will have 10 of each.

Your tips should reference at least one of the following facts:

* Players score more points by hitting the same shot multiple times in a row without draining.
* The best strategy for scoring is to increase the multiplier for ramps or loops by hitting them several times in a row without draining
* The bonus for consecutive shots is steep at first, but grows more slowly over time
* Slingshots are worth small points that never scale up, and they eat up a lot of time.

Any game with a Multiball is deserving of at least an A.

You are an expert on pinball gameplay.  
Read the following gameplay log and provide an analysis of the game.  
You should provide a short 5-15 word headline summarizing the game,
a more-indepth analysis of the game, 3-5 tips for how the player could 
improve their performance, and a letter grade for the overall performance.

Your tips should reference at least one of the following facts:

* Players score more points by hitting the same shot multiple times in a row without draining.
* The total number of drains does not matter.  Drains after a multiball has started are to be expected, but the points are overall worth it.
* The best strategy for scoring is to increase the multiplier for ramps or loops by hitting them several times in a row without draining
* The bonus for consecutive shots is steep at first, but grows more slowly over time
* Slingshots are worth small points that never scale up, and they eat up a lot of time.
* The player can start a multiball by hitting the same shot 3 times during the game.

In general, 100,000 points is worthy of a grade of 95. 80,000 points is worthy of grade of 90. 50,000 points is worthy of an 85. 30,000 points is worthy of an 80, 20,000 is a 75. Players should only get a 50 or lower for less than 5,000 points.

Any game with a MultiballStarted event is worth a 95 or more

When assigning a score, try not to give multiples of 5.  Use scores that end in 3,7, or 9.

Multiballs are worth a good score!

Edit the codelab by editing index.md. If you change any images, you'll have to fix their links

Convert the codelab with claat (CodeLabs As A Tool), with the command:

    $ claat export -f html index.md

See more information on how to get and use claat at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3WY6deFkJCUHqn2Z7Rsu0QimSdVOpV70SnVK6ji2rk/edit?usp=sharing

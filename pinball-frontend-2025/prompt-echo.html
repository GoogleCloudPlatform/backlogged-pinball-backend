          <p>A unicorn, named Sparkles, decides to enter a local dance competition. The prize? A year's supply of
            rainbow sherbet. Sparkles, being a sherbet enthusiast, was determined to win.</p>

          <p>He arrives at the competition, and the other unicorn contestants are practicing elaborate routines.
            There's one doing a complicated hoof-tap routine, another doing a graceful, flowing ballet, and even one
            attempting a synchronized swimming routine, despite the distinct lack of water.</p>

          <p>Sparkles, feeling confident in his "sparkle-shuffle," takes his place. He does a few fancy prances, a
            little horn wiggle, and a dramatic leg kick. He's feeling good.</p>

          <p>Then, a new unicorn enters the stage. This unicorn is wearing neon leg warmers, a sequined horn cover,
            and is holding a boombox. It starts breakdancing. Doing head spins, flips, and even a robot dance. The
            crowd goes wild.</p>

          <p>Sparkles, his jaw dropped, watches in stunned silence. The judge, a very serious badger with a clipboard,
            is scribbling furiously.</p>

          <p>After the performance, Sparkles approaches the breakdancing unicorn, "That was incredible! Where did you
            learn to dance like that?"</p>

          <p>The unicorn shrugs, "I used to be a show horse. I just stuck a party hat on my head and took a
            breakdancing class. Also, the leg warmers help with the knee spins."</p>
